My vim files.

Managed by Vundle, so install that on a new checkout:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    $ vim +PluginInstall +qall

I have found I need to be in the vim directory for last command.  I.e. in
~/.vim or /etc/vim


Finally move vimrc into place:
    
    $ ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
    or
    $ sudo rm /etc/vim/vimrc
    $ sudo ln -s vimrc /etc/vim/vimrc
    depending on your setup
